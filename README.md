# Loan-Prediction-Model-for-Improved-Loan-Approval-Processes-Python
This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to predicting loan approval using machine learning techniques. The dataset is preprocessed, analyzed, and then used to train a predictive model. Visualizations are created to explore the data and understand key relationships.

# Project Overview:

The code performs the following steps:

# Data Loading and Cleaning:

Loads the loan_prediction.csv data using pandas.

Handles missing values in categorical and numerical columns.

Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and relationships between features.

Identifies and removes outliers from income columns.

# Data Preprocessing:

Converts categorical columns to numerical features using one-hot encoding.

Splits the data into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

Scales numerical features using StandardScaler.

# Model Training:

Trains a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict loan approval status.

# Evaluation:

Makes predictions on the testing set and evaluates the model's performance
